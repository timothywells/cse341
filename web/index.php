            <p>My name is Timothy Wells but I prefer to go by Tim. I have been working on a couple of degrees, one of which I have already earned in Web Design and IT. However, I decided to pursue one more that covers System Administration and Back End Development. In order to get this second degree I needed to finish a few classes and retake a few classes. This class is one of the last classes that I need to take in order to graduate. However, I have been worried about my ability to do anything major. Sure I can do the basic PHP related things but I have always struggled with taking my ideas and putting them into code.</p>
            <p>Speaking of code, the interesting part about my struggle is that I can read code, debug it and modify it to fit my purposes. I can also come up with concepts, designs and solve problems that are presented to me but converting it to code is that one thing that I struggle with more than anything. My hope is that by the end of this class or even the first project I will be more able and capable of taking my ideas and putting them to code. It will be a struggle and a hard road but it will be worth it in the end.</p>
