        <h1>Week 7 - Database Access</h1>
            <h2>Team Assignment</h2>
                <p>This week we created a database, added information to it, stylized a site, set up a way to search for information on that database, retrieve it and then print that information for the user. This was an especially interesting week because of the search engine part. I plan on using it on my second project.</p>

            <h2>Individual Assignment</h2>
                <p>This week we needed to set up the visual look of our site and connect something to the database that can write and read the information to the database. In this case it is the Contact form. You can see the stored information by clicking Messages. This page will eventually be behind a login check for the admin to view.</p>
