        <h1>Week 8</h1>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p></p>
        <h2>Team Activity</h2>
            <p>This week we worked on the learnyounode project that can be found at <a href="https://nodeschool.io/">nodeschool.io</a></P>
            <p>Repository -  the repository doesn't exist, sorry.</p>
        <h2>Assignment - Hello World Node.js</h2>
            <h3>Assignment Links</h3>
                <p>You can find the assignment in my node.js file on my repository.</p>
                <p>Repository - <a href="https://github.com/timothywells/cse341">Here</a></p>
            <h3>Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.</h3>
                <p>At the moment I have everything working within the application.</p>
            <h3>Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.</h3>
                <p>Honestly, this project being an introduction to NODE.js was cool enough. This is my first experience in using NODE and I have wanted to learn it since it is something that constantly shows up as a requirement for anything related to the internet.</p>
            <h3>Describe anything you did to go above and beyond with this assignment.</h3>
                <p>As for above and beyond I mixed what was shown in the example with what I learned on the NODE home website. I also did some html editing but I could have added some CSS I assume.</p>
            <h3>Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Some attempt was made</li>
                    <li>Developing, but significantly deficient</li>
                    <li>Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate</li>
                    <li><b>Meets requirements</b></li>
                    <li>Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.</h3>
                <p>Since I didn’t do anything to fancy like add CSS or any real styling I couldn’t justify the full points. So at the very least it meets the requirements.</p>
