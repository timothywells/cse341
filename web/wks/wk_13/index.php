        <h1>Week 13</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>There was no specifically assigned reading. The only thing that we really needed to do is review all that we learned this semester. Granted the final will likely be mostly about what we learned since the last test. There really is no need to study it all since the first half was PHP and the second half was Node.</p>
            <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
                <p>This week was simple, we met up, debugged some of each others code, got some feedback and then worked on our projects. Which will be due next week. I only hope that I can get it done in time.</p>
