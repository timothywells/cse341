            <h3>Project title / one sentence description:</h3>
               <p>Google Book API access using a external web server.</p>
   
            <h3>Copy and paste the URL for your site at Heroku:</h3>

            <h3>Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):</h3>

            <h3>Describe the component that you completed from end-to-end:</h3>
               <p>I have all the functionality setup but have been struggling with getting the AJAX call to send the information that is gathered. Then once it is gathered I having trouble getting the information to run inside the the NODE function then returning the correct info. What I normally get is the correct query but the search terms are all set to undefined. I know that the call works just fine</p>
   
            <h3>Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:</h3>
               <p>1 - Some attempt was made</p>
               <p>2 - Developing, but significantly deficient</p>
               <p>3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate</p>
               <p><b>4 - Meets requirements</b></p>
               <p>5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements</p>
   
            <h3>Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.</h3>
               <p>I have spent many hours trying to get my AJAX to send the information to the server. I know that it is logging the right information, I know that it can return the API information. I have tried several types of js libraries, all of them unsuccessfully return the API calls with the query items. So that is been a major pain.I didn't delete my attempts but did comment them out.<p>
   
            <h3>Please list any questions you have for the instructor regarding this assignment or this week's topic.</h3>
               <p>I am not sure what to really ask. How about libraries, more specifically which libraries are the easiest to learn that work best with an understanding of JavaScript? I would like to do better but I feel like things are harder than they should be.</p>
