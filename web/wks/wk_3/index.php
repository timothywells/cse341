        <h1>Week 3 - Shopping Cart</h1>
        <h2>Team Assignment</h2>
            <p>This week our assignment was to create a PHP form that can handle information such as Name, Email, Radio buttons, comments, check boxes and be styled. This is something that would be helpful with the individual assignment but I got a little to worked up for the individual assignment and did not get it done this week.</p>

        <h2>Individual Assignment</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately the shopping cart was too overwhelming for me and I let it take up too much of my time, which led to me being late for all my other assignments up to Week 5. I plan on coming back to this as soon as I can in order to get it done and get some credit. I have an idea on what to do but the assignment requires using sessions instead of a database. So it will require a little more work but I have some information down.</p>
