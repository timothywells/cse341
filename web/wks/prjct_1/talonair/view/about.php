			<h3>Who is Talon Air</h3>
			<p> We are a company that has been serving the people of the Pheonix Metro for over 15 years. We started out small like any other business and shared work space with another company. As Talon Air grew so did the amount of people that wanted our excellent services. Then in 2008 and 2009 we got hit really hard with the recession. Arizona was no longer growing and neither were we. However, that was not the end for us. We stuck to the business and worked hard every day. All we knew is that with time and perseverence we would make it out of the Recession, though not unscathed. We ended up falling back to our grass roots as a small business but we still came out on top. Today we still have the same work ethic that our founders have always had and as such we bring some of the best service to both our residential and commercial clients.

					<h2>Mike King</h2>
						<p>Mike is the owner, co-founder and main HVAC technician for Talon Air, Inc.  He has been living his whole life in Arizona and started his career in HVAC work when he was only 16 years old. Since then he has worked for a few different HVAC companies then he decided a little over 15 years ago that it was time to start his own business.</p>
						<p>"It was hard at first but with time and effort I was able to build Talon Air into the business that it is today." ~ Mike King</p>
						<p>In the past 15 years Mike and his crew have worked on thousands of residential and commercial properties. More recently he decided to become a volunteer firefighter and is currently attending evening and night school to get certified. However, this does not diminish his skills or his abilities as a HVAC contractor but helps him understand, even more, the importance of fire safety and HVAC systems.</p>
